# a couple notes:
#   `git fetch` is essential, as is the explicit track flag on the second checkout.
#   I feel like this could bne more terse, but it works, is easy to understancd
#   and already ate a day, so I'm stopping for now. Maybe someone else will see an
#   obvious optimization I missed

#          git checkout -b test --track origin/test

# v1.0.24 worked
# git push origin test
